# Brackeys 2025.2 Prep

Welcome to the jam, babyyyyyyyyyyyy.

## Usage

1) Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads???windows)
2) Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Pick the MSI Windows installer.
3) Open up a terminal in whatever folder you want the files to be in
4) Run `git clone https://github.com/Teddy-Arcane/Brackeys-2025.2-Prep.git` to get the code. You'll probably need to authenticate with GitHub.
5) Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
6) Run `npm start` to start the game. You'll see a URL in the console, go there in a browser to play it.

I'd recommend running this in Visual Studio Code, but as long as you have Node and NPM installed you can just run it raw out of a directory using the terminal.

## Using Git

I currently heavily recommend [Fork](https://fork.dev/) for GUI-driven Git use.

It's nagware, but free to use forever.

`File -> Open Repository` to select the folder the code is in.

Use the `Pull` button in the toolbar to get the latest changes to the codebase.


## Building for the web

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
