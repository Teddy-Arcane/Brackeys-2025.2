talk eagre_organiser "Lets go for a run!"
The requrest catches you off-guard.
talk Facilitator "A run, where?"
talk eagre_organiser "Just in a loop around the Ward, you need to get out of these chambers and see the city more! That and I have 20 minutes spare."
And like that you're being dragged by the hand out of the chambers and onto the street, her bag of documents flopping awkwardly along behind her.
You whip past old haunts like the Cinema-now Cafe Diamente, where you saw your first scary movie.
The Museum Of The Storm-full of dust pilot paraphenalia and old dust-ships from the early days of the settlement.
The market, where vendors try to flog carts of fruit that used to pass for fresh before you saw a real fruit tree on Calypso IV.
The Engineer's Guildhall-windows barred and strange lights emenating from within.
You didn't think you'd get to see any of this again, certainly not so soon.
Something was clearly wrong with you being assigned here but you let yourself enjoy the nostalgia for a while.

You take the long way back. It's good to be home.
