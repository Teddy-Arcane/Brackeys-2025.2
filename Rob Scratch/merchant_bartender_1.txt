Karl Sera-Gabbro is listed in your file as a "proprietor". Looking further into the dossier you quickly realise this is only a fragment of the truth.
Mr Sera-Gabbro clearly has an outsized influence on all things vice on Sclera-be that drink, drugs, exotic meats, weaponry...
You're surprised to see him on your list, but by all records and accounts he's...affable, well liked, and connected.
Apparently he was presiding over his newest bar, well, it was a cinema when you were last here.
You head out of the chamber and down some smokey tunnel-alleys to the other side of the Ward.
You allow yourself the little thrill of already knowing the way, surely nobody could notice that.
The outside of the building looks much the same as you remembered, save for the pulsating projected sign declaring that this was now "Cafe Diamante".
You let yourself in and are instantly struck by how light-touch the remodelling must have been. Still dingy, slightly smokey, oddly soft carpet. A pang of nostalgia.
Walking over to the bar, you can immediately spot Karl behind the bar.
talk merchant_bartender "Ahaha, you must be the Facilitator, take a seat, please, sit!"
It seems he also spotted you as soon as you came in.

		talk merchant_bartender "You'll have a drink, of course?"
		"Do you have Babylon Soda?":

		talk merchant_bartender "Ah, a local drink! Of course, let me fix that for you."
		"I'm not permitted to partake in alchohol.":
		talk merchant_bartender "No problem at all, you should try a Babylon Soda! A real local treat if I say so myself."
The familiar tang of the canteloupe soda immediately transports you back to your youth, playing tag in the service tunnels not far from here.
talk merchant_bartender "Nothing like it, eh? Huhuheh!"
talk merchant_bartender "I hope you'll come see me over here, I can't really make it over to the chambers too often."
