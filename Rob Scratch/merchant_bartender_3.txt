Cafe Diamante seems quieter than usual this time, only a couple of patrons mill around in the booths at the back of the bar.
talk merchant_bartender "Ahaha, a Babylon Soda on ice for my favourite Facilitator! Come, lets chat."
...
~Hours pass~
talk merchant_bartender "And so I say, that's not like any Andruuvan Melt-Ice *I've* ever tasted before!"
You're hoarse from talking, where did the time go? It's been so long since you've just...talked with someone.
It strikes you in that moment that they've left you with your guard down.
talk merchant_bartender "I need a smoke and you look like you could use some air-I ain't gonna say it's fresh down here but it'll perk you up a bit!"
They lead you through a series of back rooms, crates of drink and other no-doubt illegal things piled high up against the walls.
Out a door and into a little courtyard enclosed on all sides by a dozen other buildings, potted plants and string-lights making a brave stand against the industrial dankness.
talk merchant_bartender "Here's my little sanctuary, take a seat-I'll be right back."
He disappears back inside and reappears a moment later with a a lighter and an envelope, which he tosses on the table.
talk merchant_bartender "Take a look at that."
Their eyes are hard now, shrewd.
You peel open the envelope and pull from within it a photograph...it can't be!
talk merchant_bartender "You were a real bright-eyed kid, you know. Why'dja sign up with the Corroborance anyway?"
He lights his cigarette, holding all the cards.
talk facilitator "You can't let anyone know, I don't even understand why they sent me here!"
A deep drag.
talk merchant_bartender "Of course, because we're good friends. Us Sclerans have gotta look out for eachother, right? Now get out of here. Your drinks are on me."
