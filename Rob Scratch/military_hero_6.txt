You meet with Isaiah for coffee at a little street cafe outside the chamber.
The familiar bustle of accents and smells  sets you at ease.
talk military_hero "I'm surprised, most folks take a while to acclimate to the air down here. Sticks to your tongue, doesn't it?"
You brush this off, but Isaiah looks you up and down with a keen eye. 
talk military_hero "...ah, I understand."
He gives you a knowing look and in any other circumstance it would be reassuring.
He knows you're a Sclera local?! Just from how you breathe?
Your heart is threatening to explode. Your palms are sticky. A bead of sweat on your forehead.
You take a sip of coffee.
talk military_hero "You fit right in, don't you, ahaha. I suppose...you get used to new places in your line of work."
A knowing look that turns to...concern.
talk military_hero "Anyway, I called you here to ask you something"
They place a box on the table.
Choice:
	talk military_hero "Could you accept this gift? I really feel I can trust you. Don't open it until you're offworld."
		talk facilitator "I couldn't..possibly accept this.":
		add data.suspicion 1
		talk military_hero "That's a real shame, but rules are rules I suppose."
		add data.military_hero_influence 1
		talk facilitator "...of course, thank you."
They stand up from the table.
talk military_hero "We've got a rehearsal for the Leadership ceremony in 20 minutes, I'll see you there."
