You find Isaiah commandeering one of the chamber desks, poring over an array of monitors, coffee in hand.
talk military_hero "Ah, Facilitator, take a seat."
You pull one of the chairs out from another desk. It makes a terrible echoing screech on the stone floor. Mortifying, but Isaiah seems unphased.
talk military_hero "I hope last night's demonstrations weren't too disruptive to your sleep."
talk facilitator "I am required to sleep within the pod unfortunately.
talk military_hero "Ah, a mixed blessing. Those things always gave me a sore neck when I was on deployment. Regardless, you wanted to speak with me?"
talk facilitator "You are one of the identified candidates, I am bidden to learn as much as I can. I was hoping we could discuss your service history?"
They visibly wince.
talk military_hero "The curse of notoriety, I suppose. Anything in particular? The official record is mostly right, if a little overblown"
	Choice:
	You were enlisted from an orbital outpost?:
	"Yeah, my folks were drifters with some bad debts chasing them, my service paid to get them free of that and settled down on Credence."
	Choice:
	You fought in the Bastillan campaign?:
	"Wretched place, wretched fight, wretched memories. I did my duty that day and no more. I'd trade all this fame for a single one of my friends to have made it home."
talk facilitator "You routed 3 regiments of Calladian Mercenaries with only your sword that day. I'd say that's above and beyond."
They shrug off the compliment and return to their monitors.
talk military_hero "If that will be all Facilitator, I'd rather not wax nostalgic today."
You excuse yourself. The chair makes a terrible squeal again.
