Propped up against a doorframe you spot an imposing individual, scar and eyepatch and humming photoblade close at hand-every bit the experienced soldier.
They turn to give you a deferential little bow as you approach.
talk military_hero "The Facilitator, I presume? Captain Isaiah Shackle at your service."
You've heard incredible stories of Shackle, "The Violet Edge"-their heroic exploits often came up in your nostalgic skimming of the newsfeeds.

They shift back into their more relaxed stance, pleasantries dealt with.
talk military_hero "I'm not sure how familiar you are with our departed leader. They, Berwyn, that is, they were good people despite it all. I worry Sclera is less safe today than it was a week ago."

talk military_hero "A pleasure to meet you Facilitator, but I have synaptic therapy to attend."
They snap to attention and flash you a cheeky grin with their salute before turning on heel and leaving the chamber.
