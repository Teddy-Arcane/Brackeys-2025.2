talk scheming_lady "Facilitator, you simply must join me for a spot of lunch."
Before you know it, you've been swept into a great glass conservatory, the table filled with finger sandwiches, salads and fresh fruits.
Pleasantries exchanged, Cerys steeples her fingers.
talk scheming_lady "Now, plans for my leadership. Item 1, construct a ring around the mouth of the sinkhole and restrict ship docking to there. That should cut down on those ghastly exhaust fumes.
Item 2, demolish that unfinished bypass between Chrysalis and Tinmouth Ward. 
Item 3, evict the Engineer's Guild from their Guildhouse and construct a new funicular shaft down-"
She procedes to list off dozens of improvements, both industrial and civic.  You've met the sort before.
talk facilitator "If I may, Lady Cerys, do you perhaps spend significant time working with simulations?"
A blush, you got it in one.
talk scheming_lady "It only seemed right that I should gain some experience, and Father always favoured Alun for this sort of thing when he clearly didn't have the aptitude. Nobless oblige, you know? Even if I was going to be stuck as his second."
talk facilitator "The simulations are excellent but in my experience, people are resistant to such sweeping change-even for the better."
She shoots you a glare-once again her mask falters for a moment.
talk scheming_lady "Thank you Facilitator, I will keep that in mind."
A tap on your shoulder and you are escorted out.
