He sets the box aside and gestures with his chopsticks.

talk facilitator "I was hoping to learn more about the Scleran military forces. You must all be based out of Credence City?"

talk military_hero "Good people but I worry they're mostly just in it for their pay packet and to stay out of the mines."
talk facilitator "You think they're sufficient to protect the populace? I know Officer Peril is petitioning for an increased garrison"
They avert their gaze when Peril is mentioned.  Interesting.
talk military_hero "They certainly have their...ideas. Their ambitions trouble me."
