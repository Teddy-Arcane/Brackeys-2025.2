The day draws to a close, and you take a walk through the chamber's warren of a basement.
You pass a squad of guards, smoking and playing cards. They invite you to play, but you decline.
You walk through an empty atrium, your shoes clacking in the tall stillness of the place.
In another wing you see Ser Anastasia, Housecarl Of House D'Linear, sharpening her photoblade. She regards you with a smile.
You return to the atrium, your curiosity satisfied, and press the call button for the elevator with a muffled ding.

A robed figure drops from above, landing in a heap with a crack.
And then the figure is rising, contorting and twisty and inhuman, and they're at rushing you, hissing.
choice:
 "Where do you run to?"

   In an instant, the assailant is disected and disected and disected again by the photoblade, a steaming pile.
   Ser Anastasia nods, flicks the gore from the blade, smiles, and returns to her business.
   You walk alone back to the elevator.

  "The Soldiers": 
   The soldiers grab their rifles and gun down your would-be assasin as though they were a beast.
   They say you're in shock and you're not going to deny that.
   One of them puts their coat around you and they escort you back to your pod.
