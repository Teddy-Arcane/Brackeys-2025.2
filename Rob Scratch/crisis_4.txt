Every Planet under the Corroborance, willing or not, has an anniversary festival. You've been to many in your time.
The Priesthood in their flowing gowns take to the streets with censers filled with local herbs and spices.
It's customary for those of Noble Houses and certain Guild positions to visit each ward and bestow a gift upon the people.
This year's gifts are particularly generous-a trade school, a community centre, a war memorial, and a grand feast in the streets which devolves into an all-night party.
You recall sneaking out as a child to see to experience it all, just before you took your vows.
