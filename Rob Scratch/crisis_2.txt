This evening one of the functionaries informs you that some entertainment has been arranged by the Merchants Guild.
You travel with a group of other visiting dignitaries and diplomats in a shuttle to Sclera's stadium, slightly shabby.
You take your seat in the box, and the show begins.
The master of ceremonies walks out onto the field, their image holographically mirrored into the sky above.
A classical circus complete with tightrope walking, fire eating, and general clowning unfolds.
You spend so long in stasis, it's difficult to keep track of trends, supposedly this is in vogue at the moment.
