talk eagre_organiser "You know, we really need to get to the bottom of this and work together, gang! I'm serious!"
Gloria's conference call is drawing glares from around the chamber.
She looks up from her screen, mortified, and closes the terminal.
talk eagre_organiser "I am sooo sorry, it's just...sometimes I wonder if I wear too many hats-right?"
talk eagre_organiser "It's like I can't be their boss, their friend, their comrade and their mother..."
talk Facilitator "I've never thought of it this way but I suppose being as indpendent as I am in this job does have it's advantages."
talk eagre_organiser "Oh, no disrespect but I could *never* do what you do. It seems awful, just being dropped into a random civilisation at their moment of crisis. How do you build relationships, forge trust and the like?"
talk Facilitator "I've come to hold less stock in such things, I suppose that's true. I only have 12 more rotations left though, I think I can make it."
talk eagre_organiser "12 more! That could be, what, another decade? How long have they kept you on ice?"
The thought of it is like have a bruise punched.
talk Facilitator "As long as my duty demands..."
She cracks a smile.
talk eagre_organiser "For my first order as Supreme Overchancellor or whatever I'm definitely outlawing that nonsense."
talk Facilitator "As nice as that might be...I think that's probably heresy."
